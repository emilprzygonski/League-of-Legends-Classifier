## Data
Dataset contains game statistics from first 10 minutes of ~9000 games in League of Legends. All of the games are ranked from Diamond I to Masters.
Target column is "blueWins" and it shows whether the blue or the red team won. Index columns is "gameId", rest of them describes the characteristics of the game for each team.

## Project purpose
The purpose of this project is to test a several machine learning classifiers, including deep neural network, and see which one works better.
However, as in any game there is no model that is capable to have 100% prediction accuracy after just 10 minutes of game (longest game ever lasted 90 minutes).
